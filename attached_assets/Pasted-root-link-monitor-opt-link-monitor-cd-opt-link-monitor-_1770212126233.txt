A PostCSS plugin did not pass the `from` option to `postcss.parse`. This may cause imported assets to be incorrectly transformed. If you've recently added a PostCSS plugin that raised this warning, please contact the package author to fix the issue.

- Using dynamic import() to code-split the application
- Use build.rollupOptions.output.manualChunks to improve chunking: https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-manualchunks
- Adjust chunk size limit for this warning via build.chunkSizeWarningLimit.

✘ [ERROR] Could not resolve "routeros-client"

    server/concentrator.ts:3:31:

        ╵                                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  You can mark the path "routeros-client" as external to exclude it from the bundle, which will
  remove this error and leave the unresolved path in the bundle.
